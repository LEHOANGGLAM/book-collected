As a developer at a software company, my role encompasses a range of responsibilities focused on 
creating, maintaining, and improving software solutions. I work collaboratively with cross-functional
 teams to bring ideas from concept to reality and to ensure that our software
 meets the needs of our users and clients.


My name is LÃ¢m, and I'm thrilled to be here interviewing for the software position.
over the past year, I've had the opportunity to work as a software developer at NashTech company.
During my time there, I was involved in a range of responsibilities focused on 
creating, maintaining, and improving software solutions. 
My experience allowed me to gain hands-on experience with technologies such as Docker, Kafka,
 and I also had the opportunity to work closely with cross-functional teams to translate 
user requirements into functional software solutions. 


I decided to resign from my previous company because of the circumstances surrounding my role there.
 My old company was an outsourcing company, which I initially found appealing due to the exposure 
to different projects and technologies. However, over time, the situation changed. 
The company faced a shortage of projects, and I found myself on the bench, waiting for a project for about three months. 
During this time, I felt like I didn't have the opportunity to learn and contribute effectively to the company.


	
Does the company offer any support or reimbursement for employees who want to
 pursue certifications relevant to their roles?

Are there any tax or legal considerations that remote employees working from 
Vietnam should be aware of, and does the company provide any guidance or support in this regard?

Will I take holidays in accordance with Vietnam or in accordance with your company as I work remotely?
